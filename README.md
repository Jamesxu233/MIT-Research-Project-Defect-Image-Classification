Abstract

Nowadays, with the development of industrial
production technology, defect detection has become an
indispensable part of industrial production. However, due to
various types of products and defects, it can be extremely difficult
to identify and locate those defects precisely and accurately. The
current major trend in defect detection is using convolutional
neural networks and semantic segmentation techniques to better
minimize the error rate of human eye recognition and highly
improve efficiency. Our work is based on semantic segmentation
method and combines it with transfer learning technique
enabling our model to train on a relatively small dataset without
compromising the performance, and use CNN to firstly classify
input images in order to further reduce the number of images to
improve computational efficiency and accuracy. Then through
incorporating state-of-the-art semantic segmentation model UNet++, our model achieves the best performance compared to UNet under transfer learning scenario. We compare our model
with the state-of-the-art U-Net. Then we use mIOU and pixel
accuracy to measure the modelsâ€™ performance under two
scenarios. Results illustrated that through transfer learning
scenario, our model achieves the highest scores over other
methods.
